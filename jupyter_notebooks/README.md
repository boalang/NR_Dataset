* You need to install Jupyter notebook and clone this repository on your system

Following are some application of BoaG in analyzing large scale data such as NR and its clustering information.
In some cases, the BoaG output might require visualization that we used Python libraries.

### [Run Boa<sub>g</sub> from Jupyter notebook](Boa_ipython.ipynb)

### [Annotation provenance](NR_Dataset_Provenance.ipynb)

### [Visualize tree by ETE](phylogeny.ipynb)

### [Conserved protein functions](functions.ipynb)
